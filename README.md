# WeatherApp

This application is my test project for self-study of developing Android applications.
**WeatnerApp** lets you know the current weather by your geological coordinates using geolocation for this purpose. 
More than that it's give you access to current weather data for any location on Earth. 
**WeatherApp** uses the Api from the website [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api), which allows you to check the current weather in over 200,000 cities around the world!

Again, I've never worked with Android before and this is my first application that I made from scratch, however I want to continue to develop in this direction.
